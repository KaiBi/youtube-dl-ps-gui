# youtube-dl-ps-gui

Just a small script for my family which is uncomfortable with the windows shell and needs some GUI for the simplest use case of downloading videos from youtube.

- Depends on the youtube-dl project and github repository.
- Invokes youtube-dl with only the video url as parameter.
- Checks for updates once per day.
- Uses German language.
- Windows only (downloads and executes youtube-dl.exe)
